# Roberto's Data Analytics Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. I'm passionate about turning messy data into actionable business insights, and these projects show how I approach real-world problems across different industries.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [NYC 311 Business Operations Analysis](./nyc311-business-ops-analysis/)
**What I tackled**: How does a city handle 50K+ service requests? I analyzed NYC's 311 data to understand operational patterns that tech companies could learn from - treating city service requests like customer support tickets.  
**Tools used**: Python, pandas, geospatial analysis, business intelligence, SLA monitoring  
**What I discovered**: 
- 70%+ of requests happen during business hours (major staffing insight)
- Top 3 issue types account for nearly half of all volume (specialization opportunity)
- Geographic clustering in Brooklyn and Manhattan (resource allocation goldmine)
- Specialized teams could handle 40%+ of volume more efficiently
- Weekend operations need different strategies than weekday approaches
**Bottom line**: Found ways to cut operational costs by 15-25% through smarter resource allocation. Perfect example of how operational data drives business decisions.

### [Instacart Market Analysis - 4P Marketing Framework](./instacart-insights-4p-analytics/)
**What I tackled**: Dove deep into grocery shopping patterns to optimize Product, Price, Place, and Promotion strategies  
**Tools used**: Market basket analysis, customer segmentation, SQL, Python  
**Bottom line**: Uncovered a $2.1M revenue opportunity through strategic product bundling - the kind of insight that gets C-suite attention

### [Telco Customer Churn - Who's About to Leave?](./Telco-Customer-Churn/)
**What I tackled**: Built a system to predict which telecom customers are likely to churn before they actually do  
**Tools used**: Machine learning, predictive modeling, customer analytics  
**Bottom line**: Hit 89% accuracy on churn prediction with specific retention strategies that actually work

### [Airbnb Revenue Optimization for NYC Hosts](./Optimizing-Airbnb-Listings-for-Higher-Revenue/)
**What I tackled**: Figured out how hosts can price their listings to maximize revenue without losing bookings  
**Tools used**: Regression analysis, competitive analysis, pricing optimization  
**Bottom line**: Developed a pricing model that could boost host revenue by 23% - real money for real people

### [Netflix Content Strategy Analysis](./Content-Strategy/)
**What I tackled**: What shows should Netflix invest in? Analyzed content performance and audience preferences  
**Tools used**: Content analytics, audience segmentation, strategic analysis  
**Bottom line**: Identified content gaps worth $50M+ in market opportunity

### [Facebook Marketing Performance Deep Dive](./Facebook-Metrics-Dataset/)
**What I tackled**: How to get better ROI from social media marketing spend  
**Tools used**: Social media analytics, engagement metrics, performance optimization  
**Bottom line**: Found posting strategies that increase engagement by 45% - no more guessing about what works

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Work With

**Programming**: Python (my go-to), SQL, R when needed  
**Data Analysis**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn - the usual suspects  
**Visualization**: I make charts that actually tell a story (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau)  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite  
**Tools**: Jupyter notebooks, Git, Excel (yes, still useful), Google Analytics  
**My specialties**: Making statistical models practical, A/B testing that drives decisions, customer segmentation that marketing teams can actually use

## üìä Industries I've Worked With

- **Tech & SaaS**: User behavior, growth metrics, operational analytics
- **E-commerce**: Customer lifetime value, pricing strategy, inventory optimization  
- **Telecom**: Churn prediction, customer retention strategies
- **Media**: Content performance, audience insights, engagement optimization
- **Hospitality**: Revenue optimization, competitive analysis

## üí∞ Real Business Impact

I don't just run analyses - I find money and save costs:
- **Revenue opportunities**: $2.1M+ identified across projects
- **Cost reduction**: 15-25% operational savings potential  
- **Customer retention**: Strategies improving retention by 12-18%
- **Efficiency gains**: 30-40% reduction in processing time
- **Strategic wins**: Recommendations that executives actually implement

## üéØ How I Approach Projects

Every project follows the same principle: **start with the business question, end with actionable recommendations**.

1. **Understand the real problem** - not just what data is available, but what decision needs to be made
2. **Clean and explore** - messy data is the norm, clean insights are the goal
3. **Analyze with purpose** - fancy algorithms are cool, but simple answers that work are better
4. **Communicate clearly** - stakeholders need to understand and act on findings
5. **Measure impact** - did the recommendation actually improve the business?

## üí° What Makes My Work Different

- **Business-first thinking**: I've seen too many analyses that are technically impressive but useless for decision-making
- **Industry variety**: Each sector teaches you something new about how data drives decisions
- **Technical depth with practical application**: Advanced methods when needed, simple solutions when they work
- **ROI focus**: Every recommendation includes expected business impact
- **Real-world ready**: Code and analysis you could actually implement on Monday morning

## üìà Recent Wins

- Helped identify operational inefficiencies saving 20%+ in processing costs
- Built churn models that beat industry benchmarks by 15 percentage points  
- Created pricing strategies that boosted revenue without hurting conversion
- Developed content strategies that increased engagement across multiple platforms

## üîç Always Learning

The data world moves fast, so I stay current with:
- New Python libraries and statistical methods
- Business strategy frameworks and industry trends
- Data visualization best practices
- Machine learning advances that actually matter for business
