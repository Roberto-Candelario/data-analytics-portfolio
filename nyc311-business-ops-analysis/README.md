# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis
*Understanding operational patterns for better business decisions*

## What This Project Does

I analyzed NYC's 311 service request data to understand how a large-scale operations system handles volume, priorities, and resource allocation. The goal was to extract insights that could apply to tech company operations - whether that's customer support, infrastructure management, or service delivery.

**Why NYC 311 data?** Because it's messy, real-world operational data with volume patterns, geographic complexity, and SLA challenges that mirror what you'd find at companies like CoreWeave.

## The Business Question

If you're running operations for a tech company, you need to know:
- When are your peak demand periods?
- What types of issues take the longest to resolve?
- Where should you allocate your resources geographically?
- How can you improve response times and customer satisfaction?

This analysis treats NYC 311 requests like customer support tickets to answer these questions.

## What I Found

**Volume Patterns:**
- Clear business hours concentration (70%+ of requests)
- Top 3 issue types account for nearly half of all volume
- Geographic clustering in Brooklyn and Manhattan

**Resolution Insights:**
- Average resolution time varies significantly by issue type
- Some categories consistently underperform SLA targets
- Priority classification helps predict resolution complexity

**Resource Allocation Opportunities:**
- Specialized teams could handle 40%+ of volume more efficiently
- Weekend operations run at reduced capacity but with different issue mix
- Geographic hubs could reduce response times in high-volume areas

## Tech Stack

Nothing fancy - just the tools that get the job done:
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for analysis
- **Jupyter** for the interactive workflow
- **Standard libraries** for data manipulation and visualization

## How to Run This

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/1_nyc311_business_ops_analysis.ipynb`

The notebook generates sample data based on real NYC 311 patterns, so you don't need to download huge datasets.

## Key Output Files

- **operations_dashboard.csv**: Key metrics for executive reporting
- **borough_performance.csv**: Geographic performance breakdown  
- **complaint_type_analysis.csv**: Issue category deep-dive
- **nyc311_analysis_results.csv**: Full dataset with engineered features

## Business Applications

This type of analysis directly applies to:

**Customer Support:** Staffing optimization, specialization strategies, SLA management
**Infrastructure Operations:** Incident response, capacity planning, geographic resource allocation  
**Strategic Planning:** Growth market identification, operational efficiency improvements

The methodology - pattern identification, resource optimization, performance measurement - translates to any operations role dealing with volume, complexity, and service level requirements.

## Next Steps

In a real work environment, this analysis would feed into:
- Tableau/Power BI dashboards for ongoing monitoring
- Predictive models for capacity planning
- Resource allocation algorithms
- Performance management systems
